## Supporting Rationale

We find this governance action, as proposed, to be constitutional.

The proposal meets the requirements of the *Cardano Constitution, Article III,
Section 5: Participatory Governance*

- ✅ The proposal follows a legible standard.
- ✅ The proposal provides *at least* the minimum required reationale
- ✅ The on-chain content of the proposal matches the off-chain content
- ✅ The proposal has undergone technical review and scrutiny and has not been
  found to endanger the security, functionality, performance, or long-term
  sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain.
- ✅ The proposal addresses its *expected* impact on the Cardano Blockchain
  ecosystem.

The proposal meets the requirements of the *Cardano Constitution, Appendix I,
Section 2.2: Economic Parameters, Treasury Cut*

- **TC-01**: ✅ The *treasuryCut* **is not** below 0.1
- **TC-02:** ✅ The *treasuryCut* **does not** exceed 0.3
- **TC-03:** ✅ The *treasuryCut* **is not** negative
- **TC-04:** ✅ The *treasuryCut* **does not** exceed 1.0
- **TC-05:** ✅ The *treasuryCut* **has never** been changed

## Dissenting Rationale

This governance action does not meet constitutional standards for justification,
transparency, or procedural legitimacy. While within the permitted treasury cut
range, compliance with numerical limits alone is insufficient.

The proposal lacks the required transparency and rationale (*Article III,
Section 5*), bypasses the expectation of socialization (*Article III, Section
6*), and alters economic policy without structured deliberation (*Article IV,
Section 1*). It assumes compliance without proper justification (*Appendix I,
Section 2.2*) and sets a risky precedent for governance legitimacy (*Article
VII, Section 4*).

Without supporting evidence, data, or prior discussion, its validity under the
Cardano Constitution is questionable and should be deemed unconstitutional.

## Considerations

- As mentioned in the Intersect Parameter Committee response to this protocol
  parameter update, the action rationale itself **does not** provide an
  *explicit* reversion plan. However, this proposal intends to change a single
  parameter and the **obvious** reversion plan would be to simply change the
  value back should an issue arise pursuant to *Cardano Constitution, Appendix
  I, Section 2.6*.
- This proposal bypassed the limited available and historically used platforms
  for pre-submission "socialization". However, there is years of public
  discussion across a variety of platforms regarding this parameter and the
  submission of the action, in and of itself, prompted **an awareness of and an
  opportunity to debate** the parameter and what the community would like it to
  be set to. *Cardano Constitution, Article III, Section 6*.
