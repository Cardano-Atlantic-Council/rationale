## Supporting Rationale

We find this governance action, as proposed, to be constitutional.

The proposal meets the requirements of the *Cardano
Constitution, [Article III, Section 5]: Participatory Governance*

- ✅ The proposal follows a legible standard.
- ✅ The proposal provides *at least* the minimum required reationale
- ✅ The on-chain content of the proposal matches the off-chain content
- ✅ The proposal has undergone technical review and scrutiny and has not been
  found to endanger the security, functionality, performance, or long-term
  sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain.
- ✅ The proposal addresses its *expected* impact on the Cardano Blockchain
  ecosystem.

The proposal meets the requirements of the *Cardano
Constitution, [Appendix I, Section 2.2]: Economic Parameters, Treasury Cut*

- **TC-01**: ✅ The *treasuryCut* **is not** below 0.1
- **TC-02:** ✅ The *treasuryCut* **does not** exceed 0.3
- **TC-03:** ✅ The *treasuryCut* **is not** negative
- **TC-04:** ✅ The *treasuryCut* **does not** exceed 1.0
- **TC-05:** ✅ The *treasuryCut* **has never** been changed

## Dissenting Rationale

This governance action lacks the necessary justification, transparency, and
procedural integrity required under the Cardano Constitution. While it remains
within the permissible treasury cut range of
10%-30% ([Appendix I, Section 2.2]), constitutional compliance is not merely a
matter of numerical limits but also of adherence to due process, justification
standards, and community deliberation.

### Key Grounds for Dissent

#### Failure to Meet Justification Standards ([Article III, Section 5])

The proposal does not provide empirical data, economic modeling, or stakeholder
input to substantiate its claims of improved staking incentives,
decentralization, and treasury sustainability. Without supporting evidence, the
rationale remains speculative and does not meet the constitutional requirement
for a well-justified governance action.

#### Lack of Prior Socialization ([Article III, Section 6])

The governance action bypassed essential off-chain governance processes,
including Info Actions, structured debate, and historical precedents of
community-driven decision-making. Governance actions should not be submitted
without first ensuring broad stakeholder awareness and input.

#### Unassessed Economic Risks ([Article IV, Section 1])

Reducing the treasury’s funding mechanism constitutes an economic policy change
that has not been subjected to rigorous impact assessment. The proposal assumes
that Ada price appreciation will compensate for reduced treasury inflows but
provides no economic projections or contingency plans if this assumption proves
incorrect.

#### Precedent for Procedural Erosion ([Article VII, Section 4])

Approving a governance action that lacks transparency and due diligence
establishes a dangerous precedent where future governance proposals may
similarly bypass socialization and justification requirements. This undermines
trust in governance mechanisms and weakens the principles of decentralized
decision-making.

### Final Position

By failing to meet constitutional standards for justification, transparency, and
governance integrity, this action should have been deemed unconstitutional.
However, in the event that it is passed, this dissent statement serves as a
formal record of opposition, highlighting the procedural deficiencies and
potential risks that the decision entails.

## Considerations

- As mentioned in the Intersect Parameter Committee response to this protocol
  parameter update, the action rationale itself **does not** provide an
  *explicit* reversion plan. However, this proposal intends to change a single
  parameter and the **obvious** reversion plan would be to simply change the
  value back should an issue arise pursuant to *Cardano
  Constitution, [Appendix I, Section 2.6]*.
- This proposal bypassed the limited available and historically used platforms
  for pre-submission "socialization". However, there is years of public
  discussion across a variety of platforms regarding this parameter and the
  submission of the action, in and of itself, prompted **an awareness of and an
  opportunity to debate** the parameter and what the community would like it to
  be set to. *Cardano Constitution, [Article III, Section 6]*.
