## Supporting Rationale

Article III, Section 6 of the Interim Constitution states:

> Hard Fork Initiation and Protocol Parameter Change governance actions should
> undergo sufficient technical review and scrutiny as mandated by the Cardano
> Blockchain Guardrails to ensure that the governance action does not endanger
> the security, functionality or performance of the Cardano Blockchain.
> Governance actions should address their expected impact on the Cardano
> Blockchain ecosystem.
>
> â€” Cardano Interim Constitution, Article III, Section 6

Given this, the Cardano Atlantic Council have performed the following
observations as part of our *technical review and scrutiny* prior to voting the
Plomin Hard Fork as Constitutional.

### Criteria

- Greater than 85% of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs), by stake weight and block
  production, have upgraded to a version of node software capable of
  transitioning through the hard fork.
    - Appendix I, Section 4, HARDFORK-04
- A sufficient number of SPOs have upgraded to node version 10.1.4
    - Due to a potentially critical performance vulnerability discovered in
      earlier node versions, monitoring SPO upgrades to this latest, secure
      version of the node software addresses the **security and performance**
      requirements of Article III, Section 6.
    - Article III, Section 6
- Ecosystem Tooling and Applications have indicated readiness to support the
  hard fork.
    - By reviewing Tooling and Application readiness we have ensured that the
      hard fork and this governance action
      *address their expected impact on the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.*
- A majority of centralized exchanges, by managed liquidity, have indicated
  their readiness for the hard fork.
    - Exchanges are critical ecosystem participants. Ensuring their readiness
      directly impacts user accessibility and liquidity, aligning with the
      requirement to evaluate the action's impact on the blockchain ecosystem.
