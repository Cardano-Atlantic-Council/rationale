## Supporting Rationale

As the Interim Constitutional Committee, our primary responsibility is to
safeguard the integrity of Cardano's governance framework. By choosing to
abstain from this proposal, we avoid setting a precedent in cases where
sentiment-based proposals are not tied to substantive governance changes. This
allows the community's voices to guide the process without intervention from the
Committee, preserving neutrality and ensuring that our involvement remains
focused on matters that directly impact governance or require constitutional
interpretation. **[2: Article VI, Section 1]**

## Dissenting Rationale

N/A

## Considerations
* There is nothing `Unconstitutional` about this proposal given that it
  explicitly desires no change or impact to the governance of Cardano either
  on-chain or off-chain.
> This governance action is by no means a suggestion of what Cardano protocol
> parameters should be modified to or if they should be modified at this time.
>
> Governance Action Motivation
* As written, this action does not propose any specific amount that the
  parameter should be changed to. As such, it cannot be judged by the criteria
  in the Guardrails **[3: Appendix I, Section 2.4: Technical/Security Parameters, _stakePoolTargetNum_]**.
* As written, this governance action **does not** provide a sufficient rationale
  to warrant a change to an on-chain protocol parameter as mandated by the
  Interim Constitution. **[4: Article III, Section 6]**
