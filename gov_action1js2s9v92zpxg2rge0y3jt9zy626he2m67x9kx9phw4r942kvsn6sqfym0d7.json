    "precedentDiscussion": "- As mentioned in the Intersect Parameter Committee response to this protocol parameter update, the action rationale itself **does not** provide an *explicit* reversion plan. However, this proposal intends to change a single parameter and the **obvious** reversion plan would be to simply change the value back should an issue arise pursuant to *Cardano Constitution, Appendix I, Section 2.6*.\n- This proposal bypassed the limited available and historically used platforms for pre-submission \"socialization\". However, there is years of public discussion across a variety of platforms regarding this parameter and the submission of the action, in and of itself, prompted **an awareness of and an opportunity to debate** the parameter and what the community would like it to be set to. *Cardano Constitution, Article III, Section 6*.",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "## Dissent Statement on the Governance Action to Reduce Treasury Allocation from 20% to 10%\n\nThis governance action lacks the necessary justification, transparency, and procedural integrity required under the Cardano Constitution. While it remains within the permissible treasury cut range of 10%-30% (*Appendix I, Section 2.2*), constitutional compliance is not merely a matter of numerical limits but also of adherence to due process, justification standards, and community deliberation.\n\n### Key Grounds for Dissent\n\n#### Failure to Meet Justification Standards (*Article III, Section 5*)\n\nThe proposal does not provide empirical data, economic modeling, or stakeholder input to substantiate its claims of improved staking incentives, decentralization, and treasury sustainability. Without supporting evidence, the rationale remains speculative and does not meet the constitutional requirement for a well-justified governance action.\n\n#### Lack of Prior Socialization (*Article III, Section 6*)\n\nThe governance action bypassed essential off-chain governance processes, including Info Actions, structured debate, and historical precedents of community-driven decision-making. Governance actions should not be submitted without first ensuring broad stakeholder awareness and input.\n\n#### Unassessed Economic Risks (*Article IV, Section 1*)\n\nReducing the treasury’s funding mechanism constitutes an economic policy change that has not been subjected to rigorous impact assessment. The proposal assumes that Ada price appreciation will compensate for reduced treasury inflows but provides no economic projections or contingency plans if this assumption proves incorrect.\n\n#### Precedent for Procedural Erosion (*Article VII, Section 4*)\n\nApproving a governance action that lacks transparency and due diligence establishes a dangerous precedent where future governance proposals may similarly bypass socialization and justification requirements. This undermines trust in governance mechanisms and weakens the principles of decentralized decision-making.\n\n### Final Position\n\nBy failing to meet constitutional standards for justification, transparency, and governance integrity, this action should have been deemed unconstitutional. However, in the event that it is passed, this dissent statement serves as a formal record of opposition, highlighting the procedural deficiencies and potential risks that the decision entails.",
