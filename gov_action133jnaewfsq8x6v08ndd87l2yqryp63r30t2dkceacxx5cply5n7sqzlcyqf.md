## Supporting Rationale

Appendix II of the Cardano Interim Constitution clearly laid a framework for the
process of how the Cardano community would transition through the Chang Hard
Fork, into the bootstrap or interim phase of governance, and then graduate to
a "final" Constitution after a community consultation, drafting, and
ratification process.

This process was followed throughout the summer and fall of 2024 through dozens
of workshops held worldwide, culminating in the Constitutional Conventions in
Buenos Aires, Argentina and Nairobi, Kenya in December of 2024. There, 95% of
the Constitutional delegates signaled via formal vote their support for the
proposed Constitution. At the time of the delegate ratification a hash was
created of that version of the document. That hash is the same as the proposed
document which has been publicly available since December of 2024 via GitHub.

We find that this process was open to contribution and direction by the
community [Interim Constitution, Article I, Section 2] and the decision is now,
following the Plomin Hard Fork, in the hands of the community to adopt or reject
as they see fit through themselves or their now empowered Delegated
Representatives (
DReps) [Interim Constitution, Article II, Section 2].

## Dissenting Rationale

N/A

## Considerations

We find that the pageantry and spectacle of the 60+ global, in-person workshops
and the concurrently live streamed Conventions in Kenya and Argentina were
important to the momentous and historic nature of this governance action.

However, we would advise that this was above-and-beyond the necessity for
community involvement in the process and caution against establishing too much
precedent from the events themselves and instead focusing on the outcomes (
the document).

The community should always feel empowered to meet, discuss, and propose
amendments and changes to this and future Constitutions with or without in
person meetings and spectacle, particularly if this is difficult or impossible
due to financial, legal, or other reasons.
