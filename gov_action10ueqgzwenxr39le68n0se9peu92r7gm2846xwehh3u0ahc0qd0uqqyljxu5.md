## Supporting Rationale

The published rationale for this governance action states (emphasis ours):

> In accordance with the Constitution, this **action shall be considered
> ratified with a threshold of greater than 67%** of the delegated ada to DReps
> voting in favor.

the threshold for ratification of a Net Change Limit (NCL) governance action is
defined in Appendix I, Section 3, TREASURY-O1a as follows:

> TREASURY-01a (x) A net change limit for the Cardano treasury's balance per
> period of time **must** be agreed by the DReps via an on-chain governance
> action with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake

The use of the language "**shall be considered ratified**" indicates an intent
by the author(s) of this action to subvert the limit specified by the
Constitutional Guardrails and thus makes this action _Unconstitutional_.

## Dissenting Rationale

N/A

## Considerations

- The authors used a mutable (changeable) data source for their rationale
  publication which, at least briefly, led to some issues of the hash of the
  file not matching what was publicly published. All authors of future actions
  are encouraged to use immutable (hashed) data sources to prevent this.
- The fact that the authors attempted to set a threshold that was "above and
  beyond" the limit specified by the Constitution is admirable, however,
  modifying the limits put in place by the Constitution without following the
  correct procedure for modifying the Constitution is dangerous to allow, even
  with the best of intentions.
- The Net Change Limit as defined by this proposal's rationale **does not** have
  clear start and end dates or times, leaving its applicable period open to
  interpretation by various groups during subsequent budgets and withdrawals.
- The Net Change Limit as defined by this proposal's rationale **does not**
  clearly define whether the change limit applies to the delta (difference)
  between starting balance and ending balance (i.e. whether or not revenue
  flowing into the treasury offsets spend, ostensibly making the limit of this
  proposal approximately 550M for the calendar year 2025) or whether it is
  merely a hard cap on the total amount of withdrawals allowed from the Treasury
  within a calendar year.
