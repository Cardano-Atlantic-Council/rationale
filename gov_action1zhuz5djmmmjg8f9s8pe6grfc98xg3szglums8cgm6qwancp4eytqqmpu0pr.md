## Supporting Rationale

* The interim constitution does not place restrictions, procedures, or
  requirements on the naming of hard forks. The interim constitution does
  specify that: 'utilizes wherever possible and beneficial blockchain technology
  in the governance process'. Ergo, proposing the naming of a hard fork via an
  _Info Action_ is constitutional. **[2: Preamble, Paragraph 3]**

## Dissenting Rationale

* N/A

## Considerations

* There are no established standards amongst the community or within the interim
  constitution for determining the name of a hard fork.
  **[2: Appendix I, Section 9]**
* The proposal provides little justification for the decision, however, the
  minimum requirements are provided and thus should be judged at the discretion
  of the voting and representative bodies (SPOs and dReps).
  **[2: Article III, Section 6, Paragraph 1, Sentence 2]**
* The Constitution does not provide details of the process or procedure for
  documents to be hashed, for example: compliance with CIP-100 is not a
  constitutional requirement. Given that the file was published via IPFS which
  itself already includes a hash of the document, and the provided hash is
  reproducible and verifiable **[3]**, we consider this aligned with the intent
  of the constitution. **[2: Article III, Section 6, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1]**
