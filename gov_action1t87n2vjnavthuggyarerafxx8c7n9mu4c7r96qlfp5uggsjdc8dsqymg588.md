## Supporting Rationale

* As the Interim Constitutional Committee, our primary responsibility is to
  safeguard the integrity of Cardano's governance framework. By choosing to
  abstain from this proposal, we avoid setting a precedent in cases where
  sentiment-based proposals are not tied to substantive governance changes. This
  allows the community's voices to guide the process without intervention from
  the Committee, preserving neutrality and ensuring that our involvement remains
  focused on matters that directly impact governance or require constitutional
  interpretation. **[2: Article VI, Section 1]**

## Dissenting Rationale

* N/A

## Considerations

* There is nothing `Unconstitutional` about this proposal given that it
  explicitly desires no change or impact to the governance of Cardano either
  on-chain or off-chain.
* Voting `Constitutional` on this largely positive proposal could be used as a
  precedent weapon in the future to argue for an "endorsing" vote on a proposal
  that takes a more critical and negative, potentially libelous, tone.
