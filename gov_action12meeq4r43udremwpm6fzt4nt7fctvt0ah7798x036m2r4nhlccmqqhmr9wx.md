## Atlantic Council Vote Results

| Vote             | Tally |
|------------------|-------|
| Constitutional   | 1     |
| Unconstitutional | 1     |
| Abstain          | 4     |
| Did Not Vote     | 0     |

## Supporting Rationale

Imprecise language in the proposal is causing interpretive uncertainty leading
to a split consensus amongst the Cardano Atlantic Council and forcing a vote of
abstain.

Depending on the reading of the proposed rationale it behaves as:

1. An informal poll
   > - "the DRep vote will provide crucial input for strategic alignment and
       inform future budget proposals."
   > - "gathering community consensus" ... "reflects the collective will of
       their constituents"
2. A solicitation of feedback
   > - "the Product Committee will iterate upon the roadmap based upon DRep
       feedback"
   > - "while the referenced roadmap develops, DReps should consider submitting
       multiple votes to signal approval across versions."
3. A public mandate
   > - "A yes vote for this action signals support for the proposed roadmap. A
       no vote on this action signals a lack of support for the roadmap"
   > - "A well-defined roadmap, endorsed by DReps, ensures that development
       efforts are focused and aligned with the shared vision for Cardano."
   > - "exercise their governance rights and directly influence the development
       trajectory"

Lack of clarification that the vote is non-binding can be interpreted as this
proposal seeking a decisive mandate in support or against a specific development
roadmap that could later be used as justification for budgetary actions.

This brings this action directly into the purview of the Constitutional
Committee pursuant to **Article VII, Section 4** of the Cardano Constitution:

> In the case of "Info" actions that propose a Cardano Blockchain ecosystem
> budget, Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that
> sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be
> implemented in the form contained in the "Info" action, would violate this
> Constitution.

Recognizing that our Council is divided on the interpretation of this action's
intent, we must, per our founding charter, cast a vote of Abstain on this
action.

## Dissenting Rationale

### Dissenting Rationale (Unconstitutional)

The governance action under review appears to be in violation of **Article III,
Section 5** of the Cardano governance framework, which states:

> "The content of every on-chain governance action must be identical to the
> final off-chain version of the proposed action."

The rationale provided for this governance action includes the statement:

> "A yes vote for this action signals support for the proposed roadmap. A no
> vote on this action signals a lack of support for the roadmap. An abstain vote
> means signals neither in favor nor against. While the referenced roadmap
> develops, DReps should consider submitting multiple votes to signal approval
> across versions."

Additionally, the rationale states:

> "This vote is important for gathering community consensus on the vision and
> roadmap priorities for Cardano in 2025."

While these statements provide a broad overview of the action, they fail to
address a critical issue regarding the immutability of the on-chain governance
action and its implications for governance transparency. According to **Article
III, Section 5**, the content of every on-chain governance action must be
identical to the final off-chain version of the proposed action. This
requirement necessitates that any proposed governance action be fixed and not
subject to modification once the voting process has begun.

Further, **Article III, Section 5** also specifies that

> "All owners of ADA shall have the right to ensure that the process for
> participating in, submitting and voting on on-chain governance actions is open
> and transparent and is protected from undue influence and manipulation."

This principle underlines the importance of clarity and consistency in the
governance process, ensuring that voters can be confident that they are voting
on a stable, transparent proposal.

However, the roadmap referenced in this governance action is subject to change.
This presents a significant issue, as the governance action's content would no
longer match the original version that was presented for voting. The potential
for continuous updates to the roadmap makes it impossible to ensure that the
same version of the action is being voted on, which undermines the principles of
transparency and immutability in the governance process.

The core issue here is that there is no way to guarantee that every DRep or
Constitutional Committee (CC) member is voting on the exact version of the
roadmap that was originally presented. As the roadmap evolves, multiple votes
could be submitted to reflect new versions of the roadmap, but without a clear
and fixed version being presented at the time of voting, this introduces
ambiguity and uncertainty regarding which version is being approved.

This lack of clarity about which version of the roadmap is being voted on could
compromise the legitimacy of the vote outcome, making it difficult to
confidently assert whether the threshold for approval has been met. This
undermines the core principles of governance transparency and accountability,
and the protection of the process from undue influence and manipulation, thus
rendering the governance action unconstitutional.

### Dissenting Rationale (Constitutional)

After a thorough review of the proposal and linked Roadmap, there are no
commitments in this on-chain INFO action proposal that are deemed
Unconstitutional and therefore, by default, it is deemed Constitutional. A YES
vote to deem this INFO constitutional does not mean the roadmap itself is
approved, a YES vote only indicates the INFO action proposal is correctly
submitted and used in the proper context and for the correct purpose as defined
by the Constitution.

The INFO action proposal is a poll, as described, that gauges DRep sentiment and
includes instructions for DReps to provide feedback in the metadata, which to
date, some of the DReps have understood the assignment as evidenced by feedback
posted in the metadata for both YES and NO votes. As stated in the proposal “The
DRep vote will provide crucial input for strategic alignment and inform future
budget proposals, including the current budget conversations.” which is the
correct use of an INFO according to the Constitution.

**Article III, Section 4** of the Constitution states:

> A special form of on-chain governance action, an "Info" action, exists to
> allow the Cardano Community to propose potential future on-chain governance
> actions and to allow community sentiment to be gauged without committing to
> any on-chain change to the Cardano Blockchain.

## Considerations

- We recognize that there is little to no precedent on the format or methodology
  of the Info Governance Action and applaud the proposers for experimenting with
  community governance via this informational governance action.
- The Atlantic Council has previously abstained in reference to Info Actions
  that were merely symbolic and had no on-chain
  impact ([Ikigai Proposal](gov_action1t87n2vjnavthuggyarerafxx8c7n9mu4c7r96qlfp5uggsjdc8dsqymg588.md)).
  However, this proposal walks a fine line between a simple poll/temp check and
  a public mandate.
- If a similar proposal were to be made in the future, it should include and/or
  reference a hashed version of the "roadmap" or other document it seeks
  feedback on to ensure that the document is not modified or changed after
  governance actors have begun to vote on it.
