# Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10% Governance Action Analysis

This governance action to reduce the treasury cut from 20% to 10% lacks
sufficient justification and does not provide the necessary analysis to support
its claims. The proposal relies on assumptions rather than data-driven insights,
making it a risky and unsubstantiated modification to Cardano’s financial
structure.

## Governance Action Claims

This section categorizes the key claims made in the governance action.

1. **Treasury Cut and Staking Rewards**
    - Reducing the treasury cut from 20% to 10% will:
        - Enhance staking incentives.
        - Improve decentralization.
        - Align economic sustainability with long-term Cardano ecosystem growth.
    - A lower treasury increases staking rewards, encourages broader
      participation, and strengthens security while maintaining a sustainable
      treasury.
    - This change will result in a 12.5% increase in staking rewards across the
      network.
    - If current staking APY is 4.0%, the tax reduction will increase APY to
      approximately 4.5%.
2. **Treasury Sustainability**
    - The ADA price appreciation is the primary mechanism that ensures treasury
      sustainability, rather than transaction volume growth.
    - At significantly higher ADA valuations, the treasury will remain
      well-funded even with a lower tax rate. Treasury reserves will remain
      sufficient to fund governance, development, and long-term initiatives
      without over-relying on a high tax rate.
    - Treasury funding should shift toward transaction activity and organic
      ecosystem growth rather than tax-based funding.
3. **Governance and Economic Justification**
    - This proposal follows a structured governance process similar to the
      Plutus V3 cost model update.
    - The change does not compromise the financial health of the treasury but
      instead ensures a balanced economic model that optimizes incentives while
      maintaining sustainability.
4. **Competitive Advantages**
    - A leaner treasury encourages competitive grant proposals and strategic
      allocation of resources.
    - The new incentive model will make Cardano more attractive to developers
      and enterprises.
    - A lower treasury cut will promote organic ecosystem participation instead
      of reliance on treasury allocations.
    - The change improves decentralization by encouraging more ADA holders to
      stake and reducing centralization risks among stake pools.
5. **Governance and Constitutional**
    - Alignment The proposal remains within the constitutional treasury cut
      range (10%-30%) (_[Appendix I, Section 2.2]: TC-01, TC-02_).
    - The governance action does not alter governance structures but optimizes
      staking incentives.
    - DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee oversee treasury
      management (_[Article III, Section 2]_).
6. **Governance Efficiency**
    - This proposal follows past governance action formats and ensures alignment
      with constitutional parameters.
    - A structured review mechanism can be introduced to assess the impact of
      the change and make future adjustments if needed.
    - The governance action’s rationale is based on internal economic mechanics
      rather than comparisons to external blockchains.

## Key Observations on These Claims

The proposal relies heavily on assumptions rather than direct data, making
economic projections such as a 12.5 percent increase in staking rewards without
referencing any modeling, empirical data, or prior studies to substantiate them.
While it asserts constitutional alignment, it fails to address whether the
absence of supporting evidence, including economic analysis or stakeholder
discussions, could render the governance action unconstitutional. Additionally,
no off-chain documentation or proof of prior socialization has been provided to
support these claims, raising concerns about the transparency and legitimacy of
the proposal.

## Supporting Links Provided

This section lists the off-chain data and justifications referenced in the
governance action, assessing whether they provide sufficient evidence to support
its claims.

- Staking and Rewards Mechanics:
    - https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/delegation
    - The stake delegation link explains delegation in Cardano but does not
      support the proposal’s claim that reducing the treasury cut improves
      staking incentives, decentralization, or sustainability. It also lacks
      required justification, including socialization records, economic
      modeling, or impact analysis.
- Cardano Shelley Genesis File

    - The Shelley Genesis File outlines Cardano’s blockchain parameters,
      including the 20% treasury cut, but does not justify the proposal’s claims
      about reducing it to 10%. As a historical reference, it lacks economic
      analysis, socialization records, or stakeholder discussions, failing to
      meet constitutional justification requirements.
- Cardano Treasury with Kevin Hammond
    - https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/community-governance-oversight/catalyst-parameters/governance-parameters/cardano-treasury-with-kevin-hammond
    - The Kevin Hammond presentation explains treasury funding and governance
      but does not support the proposal’s claims. It lacks evidence that the 20%
      cut was arbitrary or that reducing it to 10% ensures sustainability.
      Additionally, it provides no record of socialization or stakeholder
      discussions, making it insufficient to substantiate the governance action.

## Evaluating Justification in Governance Actions

This section examines the standards for justifying governance actions,
emphasizing the need for evidence, transparency, and structured reasoning. It
outlines key elements of a well-supported claim, highlights the risks of
inadequate justification, and assesses whether the governance action meets
constitutional and procedural requirements.

### Justifying a Claim in Governance Actions

Justifying a claim requires more than stating an idea; it must be supported by
evidence, reasoning, and transparency. A well-justified claim includes:

- Clarity: Clearly state the assertion.
- Evidence: Provide historical data, studies, or real-world examples.
- Logical reasoning: Explain cause and effect.
- Consideration of counterarguments: Address alternative perspectives.
- Transparency: Identify assumptions and limitations.
- Risk assessment: Outline potential risks and mitigation strategies.
- Verification: Encourage peer review, simulations, or expert evaluations.

### Relevant Supporting Materials

To meet justification standards, a governance action should include:

- Data or evidence supporting the proposal.
- Technical analyses or reports demonstrating feasibility.
- Community feedback or prior discussions (e.g., forum posts, meeting notes, or
  governance debates).
- Comparisons to similar changes in other blockchain ecosystems.
- Legal or regulatory considerations, if applicable.

### Consequences of Ignoring Justification

When justification is weak or absent, governance decisions become speculative
and unreliable, leading to:

- Assumption-based decisions instead of fact-driven ones.
- Increased ecosystem risk due to untested changes.
- Erosion of trust in governance processes.

This governance action lacks economic analysis, impact assessment, and risk
evaluation, introducing unnecessary risks and should not be accepted in its
current form.

## The Issue with the Approach

The GA assumes constitutional compliance simply because it stays within the
permitted treasury cut range (10%-30%). However, it ignores the procedural and
transparency obligations that governance actions must follow.

- It lacks evidence of socialization, stakeholder input, or prior discussion
  before submission.
- It fails to meet the justification standard required under
  _[Article III, Section 5]_.
- It contradicts _[Article III, Section 6]_, which expects governance actions to
  be shaped through off-chain governance mechanisms before being submitted.

## Direct Constitutional Challenges to the Governance Action

This section examines how the governance action fails to meet constitutional
requirements for justification, transparency, and procedural legitimacy. It
outlines key constitutional clauses that the proposal violates, highlighting the
lack of socialization, missing economic analysis, and the risks of setting a
dangerous precedent for governance legitimacy. Each challenge is directly tied
to constitutional provisions, demonstrating why the proposal does not meet the
required standards.

### The proposal asserts:

> “The new constitution explicitly permits treasury cuts between 10% and 30%
> ([Appendix I, Section 2.2]: TC-01, TC-02). The interim constitution also
> establishes governance guidelines that align with maintaining financial
> stability ([Article III, Section 3]). This governance action remains within
> those limits and upholds fiscal sustainability principles.”

However, the proposal fails to address whether a lack of supporting evidence (
data, analysis, socialization, economic modeling, or stakeholder discussions)
makes it unconstitutional under _[Article III, Section 5]_ and
_[Article III, Section 6]_ of the Constitution.

### 1. The GA Lacks Required Transparency and Justification

Relevant Constitutional Clause: _[Article III, Section 5]_

> “In order to promote transparency in the process of on-chain governance, prior
> to being recorded or enacted on-chain, all proposed governance actions are
> expected to follow a standardized and legible format including a URL and hash
> of all documented off-chain content to the Cardano Blockchain. The rationale
> shall include, at a minimum, a title, abstract, reason for the proposal, and
> relevant supporting materials.”

#### Justification and Transparency Requirements:

- Governance actions must provide a URL and hash of all documented off-chain
  content.
- They must also include sufficient rationale, which consists of:
    - A title
    - An abstract
    - A reason for the proposal
    - Relevant supporting materials

#### Challenge:

The governance action lacks justification and required off-chain documentation:

- No economic modeling or empirical data supports the claimed 12.5% increase in
  staking rewards.
- No socialization records show stakeholder review before submission.
- No evidence supports long-term treasury sustainability under the proposed
  change.

### 2. Governance Actions Must Be Socialized Before Submission

Relevant Constitutional Clause: _[Article III, Section 6]_

> “The Cardano Community is expected to support the creation, maintenance, and
> ongoing administration of off-chain governance processes as may be necessary
> to give effect to this Constitution and to ensure that there is awareness of
> and an opportunity to debate and shape all future governance actions for the
> Cardano Blockchain.”

#### Requirement for Off-Chain Governance Awareness and Debate The Cardano

- Community is expected to support off-chain governance processes.
- Governance actions should be debated and shaped before submission to ensure
  transparency and legitimacy.

#### Challenge:

Governance actions are expected to be debated before being recorded on-chain,
but this proposal lacks evidence of prior discussion or stakeholder input,
violating transparency and deliberation standards.

- The Info Action precedent (_[Article III, Section 4]_) shows major economic
  policy changes should be socialized before submission.
- The Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) process reinforces the need for
  structured review before finalization.
- Governance workshops and town halls have set a precedent for major decisions
  to undergo socialization.

By bypassing these established processes, this governance action contradicts
_[Article III, Section 6]_, which expects governance decisions to be openly
discussed and shaped before submission.

### 3. Economic Policy Changes Require Deliberation

Relevant Constitutional Clause: _[Article IV, Section 1]_

> “Cardano Blockchain Treasury funds shall be used for the benefit of the
> Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem and the Cardano Community, as determined by
> governance actions in accordance with this Constitution.”

#### Challenge:

This proposal does not withdraw treasury funds but alters its economic structure
by reducing its funding mechanism. Such a change qualifies as an economic policy
shift that requires rigorous discussion.

- The long-term impact of reducing treasury inflows has not been analyzed.
- The sustainability of future governance and development under a lower treasury
  tax remains unassessed.
- The claim that ADA price appreciation will sustain the treasury lacks
  supporting analysis.

Governance actions affecting financial stability should not be rushed. Without a
structured impact assessment, this proposal risks undermining Cardano’s
long-term sustainability.

### 4. The Proposal Assumes Compliance Without Addressing the Justification Standard

Relevant Constitutional Clause: _[Appendix I, Section 2.2] (TC-01, TC-02)_

> “The treasury cut may be adjusted within a range of 10% to 30%.”

#### Challenge:

The governance action assumes constitutional compliance simply because the
treasury cut remains within the 10 to 30 percent range. However, numerical
limits do not override procedural requirements.

- Justification is missing with no risk assessment, financial modeling, or
  stakeholder engagement.
- Transparency is lacking with no Info Action, town hall discussion, or formal
  debate before submission.
- Arbitrary changes are not permitted as the constitution requires
  justification, transparency, and due deliberation.

While the numerical range is constitutional, the submission process is not.
Governance actions require due diligence and procedural legitimacy, not just
adherence to numeric constraints.

### 5. This Sets a Dangerous Precedent for Governance Legitimacy

Relevant Constitutional Clause: _[Article VII, Section 4]_

> “The Cardano Community shall establish processes for the transparent and
> responsible management of Treasury funds.”

#### Challenge:

This governance action sets a precedent for enacting major financial policy
changes without socialization, opening the door to future governance abuses.

- Future actors could bypass community input to push through changes.
- Legitimacy concerns may weaken trust in governance, discouraging
  participation.
- A lack of economic oversight increases the risk of unforeseen financial
  instability.

To maintain governance integrity, all economic policy changes must undergo
deliberation, transparency, and rigorous analysis.

## Conclusion

This governance action does not meet constitutional standards for justification,
transparency, or procedural legitimacy. While within the permitted treasury cut
range, compliance with numerical limits alone is insufficient.

The proposal lacks the required transparency and rationale
(_[Article III, Section 5]_), bypasses the expectation of socialization
(_[Article III, Section 6]_), and alters economic policy without structured
deliberation (_[Article IV, Section 1]_). It assumes compliance without proper
justification (_[Appendix I, Section 2.2]_) and sets a risky precedent for
governance legitimacy (_[Article VII, Section 4]_).

Without supporting evidence, data, or prior discussion, its validity under the
Cardano Constitution is questionable and should be deemed unconstitutional.

## Challenging a Governance Action Submitted Without Socialization

This document addresses the broader issue of governance actions submitted
without prior socialization. In any decentralized governance system,
transparency, structured discussions, and open deliberation are critical to
ensuring legitimacy and community alignment. When governance actions are
proposed without prior engagement, they risk bypassing crucial stakeholder
input, reducing trust, and undermining the collaborative nature of
decision-making.

It challenges the assumption that governance actions can bypass socialization.
Even if prior socialization is not explicitly required in the constitution, it
is implicitly necessary for accountability, legitimacy, and participatory
governance. The expectation of broad community input before enacting economic
policy changes is a core principle of decentralized governance.

If this governance action proceeds without challenge, it will weaken Cardano’s
governance framework and open the door for unchecked, arbitrary decision-making.
Ensuring transparency and procedural integrity is essential to preserving the
decentralized ethos of Cardano.
