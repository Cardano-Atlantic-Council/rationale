## Supporting Rationale

This governance action proposing a Net Change Limit (NCL) for the Cardano
ecosystem is Constitutional.

## Dissenting Rationale

N/A

## Consideration

- The Net Change Limit as proposed by this governance action **does** define
  clear and precise start and end points, reducing ambiguity and
  interpretational uncertainty when measuring future budget and treasury
  withdrawal actions against this NCL.
- The Net Change Limit as proposed by this governance action **does** clearly
  define that the Net Change Limit should be considered a cap on the total
  amount of Treasury Withdrawals during its enactment period, regardless of
  Treasury revenue during that time.
- Should a scenario occur where this and the earlier proposed NCL Governance
  Action (
  gov_action10ueqgzwenxr39le68n0se9peu92r7gm2846xwehh3u0ahc0qd0uqqyljxu5) both
  pass and become ratified by DReps, this proposal would nullify the earlier
  proposal for both 2025 and 2026. The proposed 2025 NCL as presented in this
  action would be enforced and the 2026 NCL proposed by the earlier action would
  be invalidated and need to be submitted via a new and separate action.
